#### Baccarat

Define the number of shoes. The higher the number of shoe the closer the actual result will 
be to the calculated odds. Check [Wizard of Odds](https://wizardofodds.com/games/baccarat/basics/) for reference.

To run the code, type this on the console:

```bash
$ python baccarat.py num_shoes
```
